## Abstract
### Background/Objective
Diabetes mellitus presents a tremendous burden on individuals’ quality of life. Despite advancements in treating and diagnosing diabetes, it continues to be a growing crisis in the United States (US). Additionally, sleep duration/quality is a pervasive issue in the US, and a well-known risk factor for diabetes. However, despite large amount of studies focusing on diabetes and sleep, only a sparse amount of research has been geared towards Asian-Americans. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the association between diabetes/prediabetes and sleep duration/quality in Asian-Americans.
### Methods/Results
Using data from the NHANES 2011-2016 (National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey), diabetes, prediabetes, and normal, were defined as A1c levels above 6.4%, between 5.7%-6.4%, and less than 5.7%, respectively. Sleep duration was categorized as very short (≤6 Hours) (VSSD), short (6-7 Hours) (SSD), normative (7-8 Hours) (NSD), and long (>8 Hours) (LSD). Sleep quality was categorized into poor (PSQ) and normal (NSQ). Sleep duration was stratified by poor and normal sleep quality. Findings showed that Asian-Americans who reported having LSD/NSQ, VSSD/PSQ, and NSD/PSQ were at 2.32 (95% CI 1.05-5.14, p <0.038), 3.07 (95% CI 1.18-8.00, p <0.023) and 2.83 (95% CI 1.39-5.76, p <0.005) higher odds of having diabetes, respectively.
### Discussion/Conclusion
The findings of this study align with results from prior literature. This study elucidates the relationship between sleep and diabetes in Asian-Americans, a subgroup which has not been at the focal point of social diabetes research; thereby, contributing to an area of research which is deeply lacking.

## Introduction/Background
### Type II Diabetes
Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that is manifest in the forms of elevated glycemic levels within the blood. It is linked to several serious health complications such as cardiovascular and kidney diseases, with numerous cases going unreported. 1 Diabetes presents a tremendous burden on individuals’ health as well as their quality of life. And, despite clinical advancements in treating and diagnosing diabetes, it continues to be a growing crisis in the US. 
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the prevalence of diabetes is currently estimated at 9.4% of the total US population, and of those diagnosed 23.8% are reportedly undiagnosed. Moreover, the prevalence of prediabetes is estimated to be at a staggering 33.9%. 1 Even more striking is that the diabetic population continues to rise. For those 45- to 65- years old and ≥65 years old, the incidence rates are 10.9 and 9.4 per 1,000 people, respectively, while for those 18-44 years old the rate is 3.1 per 1,000 people. Therefore, in conjunction with the emergence of an aging population and high incidence rates for older cohorts, it can be appropriately presumed that a significant number of cases of diabetes will develop. This is problematic. 
Diabetes is associated with a myriad of risk factors that includes, but is not limited to, obesity, poor diet, hypertension, smoking, drinking, and sedentary behavior. 1 This set of risk factors are widespread in the US, therefore, to curb the growing issue of diabetes targeted studies aimed towards the relationship between modifiable risk factors and diabetes is imperative.
Sleep Duration
A great deal of research has established a strong association between sleep duration and diabetes. In an 8- to 10-year follow-up study conducted in the US, it was found that subjects who reported having short sleep (≤5 Hours) and long sleep (≥9 Hours) were, respectively, at 1.47 and 1.52 higher odds of developing diabetes than healthy individuals. 3 Moreover, in a 5-year cross-sectional study conducted in China, investigators discovered that individuals who reported having short sleep (≤5 Hours) in combination with poor quality of sleep, were at 6.21 times higher risk of developing diabetes than healthy individuals. 4 This poses a major concern for the population because it is estimated that 35.3% of adults (≥18 years old) report sleeping less than 7 hours on average, 5,6 exposing a large portion of the population at risk. 
However, a topic that needs to be addressed is defining what constitutes short and long sleep durations. Several articles define short sleep as less than 5 hours, while some report any duration less than 7 as short sleep. According to the National Sleep Foundation, the recommended number of sleep hours vary by age. 18 It is recommended that adults above the age of 18 receive 7 to 8 hours of sleep and even longer depending on how young one is. 18 However, it is also recommended with a caveat that sleep hours only represent what may constitute the recommended range and may be subject to change from person to person. 18 Therefore, it is crucial to analyze literature concerning sleep durations with this caveat in mind. 
### Sleep Quality
Along with duration, poor sleep quality is also a recognized risk factor for developing diabetes and elevating HbA1c levels in individuals. It has been reported that an estimated 50 to 70 million US adults have been diagnosed with some degree of a sleep disorder in 2010. 2 Roughly 30% of US adults have reported having short-term insomnia; 10% of US adults reported having chronic insomnia; 7 and 37.9% have reported having one or more days of unintentional sleep within the past month. 2 Investigators, conducting a cross-sectional study using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), found that people who reported difficulty in maintaining sleep ≥5 times/month and waking up too early ≥5 times/month were associated with 3.50 and 2.69 higher odds of becoming prediabetic, respectively. 8 Moreover, nearly half the US adult population reported snoring associated with their sleep. 2 In a study conducted in South Korea, it was found that among healthy populations, women who reported having frequent to constant snoring, a facet of poor sleep quality, presented higher HbA1c levels than those who reported never to occasional snoring. 9 A significant portion of the population are suffering from poor sleep, which may lead individuals to become dependent on sleep-inducing alternatives that may cause adverse consequences, however that is beyond the scope of this review; the main takeaway is that sleep quality is widely reported in the US adult population, allowing a significant number of people to be susceptible to prediabetes and diabetes that is contributing to a global crisis that needs to be addressed.
### Ethnic Variation in Diabetes
Diabetes is a complex disease that is elicited by several factors, including sex, race/ethnicity, and social behavior, must be considered in understanding and addressing the disease. Specifically, several studies have highlighted racial and ethnic differences. In a study by Gujral et. al, investigators found that while the overall prevalence of diabetes was higher in Asian Indians than in US Blacks and Hispanics, when adjusted for age, it was found that US Blacks and Hispanics presented higher odds of developing diabetes. 10 The authors postulated that the higher prevalence of diabetes in Asian Indians may be an outcome of underlying innate susceptibilities that play a role in pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction in Asian Indians, which were not evident in the US subgroups. 10 This conclusion is noteworthy because it does not fall into the general pattern found in Asian Americans. In a large metabolic study conducted in the US, it was found that insulin resistance was higher in non-Hispanic Blacks (NHB) and Hispanic Americans than in Asian Americans. 11,13 The estimated age-adjusted prevalence of diabetes of Asian Americans were 8.4% compared to NHB and Hispanic Americans who presented 12.6% and 11.8%, respectively, 11 which is conflicting with the conclusions found in the study by Gujral et. al. Moreover, the claims that diabetes is more prevalent in NHB and Hispanics were supported by an article by Haffner et al., which found increased insulin resistance and secretion in non-diabetic NHB and Hispanic Americans compared to non-Hispanic Whites. 12 However, in a study conducted in non-American Asians by Rhee, it was found that Gujral et al., claims may hold merit. It was found that Asians are more prone to developing diabetes at lower body mass index (BMI) due to having higher levels of visceral fat. 14 Rhee also claimed that while the prevalence of diabetes in western countries have remained relatively stable, the prevalence of diabetes in countries such as China and Korea have increased at tremendous rates due to changes in dietary habits. 14 This notion opens discussion on how diet and other factors in the US can affect Asians with their predisposed genetic disposition to diabetes.
### Limited Research on Asian Americans despite Rising Population Levels
According to the latest 2010 US Census Bureau, Asian Americans, which are described as people from the Far East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, were reported to be the fastest growing subpopulation in the US. 17 In 2000, it was reported that 5.6% of the US population, or 11.6 million people, were reported as being Asian, between 2000 and 2010, the Asian American population had risen by 43%, which was roughly four times higher than any other sub-population growth during this period, rising to 17.3 million Asian Americans. 17 However, research aimed towards this sub-population has not been at pace, which is highly concerning. While vast amounts of research have been conducted on the association between diabetes and sleep in US subpopulations, very few have been aimed towards Asian American populations, despite the increase of Asian in the US. Therefore, it is evident that support for research on this subpopulation is much needed.
### Biopsychosocial Model
To aptly investigate the objective of this study, the biopsychosocial model was used to facilitate the inception of contextual knowledge that may lead to varying outcomes between Asians and Asian Americans. The biopsychosocial model, which was developed by Engel, provides a structured framework that ties biological, social and psychological domains in ascertaining a holistic comprehension of health outcomes. 15,16 This study focuses on the implications of diabetes brought on by sleep behaviors in US populations. While issues with sleep can be clinical, sleep issues may also be elicited by social and psychological factors that can lead to adverse health outcomes such as prediabetes and diabetes. It has been postulated that Asians may carry an underlying susceptibility for elevated glycemic levels that has not been evident in other subgroups; therefore, an understanding of the polarizing social and psychological environments that both Asians and Asian Americans are exposed to need to be accounted for. Familiarizing an entire subset of Asians to a set of a different social and psychological Western factors, in conjunction with carrying a potential underlying susceptibility for elevated glycemic levels, can lead to unprecedented health disparities. Diabetes is a modifiable chronic disease attributed heavily to behavior and genetics, therefore, utilizing this model to facilitate the thought process behind constructing the scaffolding of this study is imperative. 
Diabetes is a multi-faceted disease. Therefore, an understanding of the likenesses and variances of the biological, sociological, and psychological domains between Asians and Asian Americans is necessary. When examining the dichotomy of Western and Eastern cultures, the level of exposure to myriad of factors may contribute to different glycemic outcomes. Given that Asians have been postulated to carry a genetic susceptibility for elevated glycemic levels, this study will benefit tremendously by understanding the varying social and psychological context Asian Americans are exposed to, in comparison to Asians. Asian Americans have evidently far higher exposure to Westernized diets, culture, and social norms, which will increase the gap in commonalities that Asians and Asian Americans once shared. Having a sound background in these three domains are crucial for grasping the importance of certain factors and examining the objective of this study. Research on Asian Americans have been sparse; however, to appropriately  investigate Asian Americans requires an acknowledgement that Asians and Asian Americans are two diverse subgroups, and comparisons between both groups need to be adjusted for crucial social and psychological factors. If research in Asian Americans continue to be researched through a myopic lens, investigators and clinicians and future populations will be rendered ineffective in halting an unforeseeable crisis at a magnitude they may not be prepared to absorb. 
The proposed study will aim to investigate the association between sleep duration/quality and glycemic status among Asian-Americans in the United States. The findings of this study will incorporate all facets of the biopsychosocial model to estimate an appropriate prediction. It is predicted that Asian-Americans will have similar findings as with the findings from the Asian studies, however, will have a less uniform result that are manifest in Asian studies, due to the variation of cultural and social acceptance of Westernized ideals among Asian Americans. 
## Methods
### Data Source and Study Design
Data were used from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2016. The NHANES is a national, cross-sectional survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Data were collected through personal interviews, physical examinations, laboratory tests, nutritional assessments, and DNA repositories, for assessing the health and nutritional status of the US population. Interviews were conducted at participants’ homes or mobile examination centers by trained interviewers or computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI) system. Hand cards were used to facilitate interviews through multiple languages, English, Spanish, Mandarin Chinese (Traditional and Simplified), Korean, and Vietnamese if proxies or interpreters were not present. 19
### Participants and Data Collection
The population of interest was Asian Americans in the United States. After merging sample populations from the NHANES 2011-2016, the initial sample consisted of 29,902 participants. Participants reported as being Asian American were isolated for the study (n=3,398). Asian American participants under the age of 25 years old were excluded to remove potential subjects that were diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes (nexcluded=14,653). Asian American participants who were told they were diagnosed with a sleep disorder by a physician were excluded (nexcluded=50). Asian American participants who reported having gestational diabetes were excluded (nexcluded=15). The final analytic study sample size was 1,725. NHANES and all translations were approved by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) Research Ethics Review Board (ERB). 20 All participants provided informed consent. 19
### Measures
The main exposures were sleep duration and quality. Sleep duration was assessed by asking participants, “How much sleep do you usually get (hours)?”. Sleep duration was categorized as very short sleep (≤6 Hours) (VSSD), short sleep (6-7 Hours) (SSD), normative sleep (7-8 Hours) (NSD), and long sleep (>8 Hours) (LSD). Sleep quality was assessed by asking participants, “Ever told doctor had trouble sleeping?”. Sleep quality was categorized into two categories, poor (PSQ) and normal quality of sleep (NSQ). Sleep duration was stratified between poor and normal quality sleep. 
The main outcome is glycemic status (normal/diabetes/prediabetes). Participants will be assessed using HbA1c levels. HbA1c levels below 5.7% were defined as normal, levels between 5.7% and 6.4% were defined as prediabetes, and levels above 6.4% were defined as diabetes. 
The covariates of interest included age, sex, citizenship status, marital status, body mass index (BMI), physical activity (PAQ), depression, alcohol, smoking, and hypertension. Age was measured as a continuous variable. Sex was treated as binary categorical variable, female and male. Citizenship status was measured as a citizen or not a citizen. Marital status was measured as married, formerly married, never married, and living with a partner. BMI was calculated by measured weights (kg) and heights (cm). BMI levels were categorized as less than 18.5 kg/m2 as underweight, between 18.5 and 24.9 kg/m2 as normal, and between 25.0 and 29.9 kg/m2 as overweight, and between 30.0 and 39.9 kg/m2 as obese, and above 40.0 kg/m2 as extremely obese. Depression was measured using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Depression was assessed by asking participants, “Have little interest doing things”, “Feeling down, depressed, or hopeless”, “Trouble sleeping or sleeping too much”, “Feeling tired or having little energy”, “Poor appetite or overeating”, “Feeling bad about yourself”, “Trouble concentrating on things”, “Moving or speaking slowly or too fast”, and “Thought you would be better off dead”, which were compiled to produce a PHQ-9 depression scale. PHQ-9 scores between 0-10 were treated as having no depression and 11-20 as having depression. 21 The PHQ-9 scale reliability coefficient with this analytic sample was 0.842. Physical activity was considered as none, moderate, and vigorous. Smoking was considered as never, former, and current smoker. Alcohol was measured as consuming at least 12 drinks within the last year. Blood pressure levels were compiled from 2nd and 3rd measures and systolic blood pressure levels less than 120 mmHg were measured as normal, levels between 120 and 129 mmHg as elevated, levels between 130 and 139 mmHg as Stage 1 hypertension, and levels between 140 and 179 mmHg as Stage 2 hypertension.
### Statistical Analyses
Sampling weights were used to adjust for complex survey design of the NHANES. Variance estimates for complex survey were computed using the Jackknife resampling procedure to produce conservative standard error estimates. Descriptive statistics were conducted using proportions and normality and skewness were tested through histograms and Shapiro-Wilk tests. Summary and tabulation statistics were used to examine frequency distributions, means, and standard deviations of variables. All statistical analyses were conducted at 0.05 significance level and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were provided for estimates. 
Cross-tabulations were used to examine bivariate statistics. Comparisons between covariates and glycemic status were conducted using χ2 tests for categorical variables and two-sample t-tests for normally distributed, continuous variables. 
Stepwise logistic regression was used to model glycemic status by sleep duration and sleep quality, while adjusted for age, sex, marital status, citizenship status, BMI, physical activity, alcohol, smoking, and hypertension. All analyses were conducted using Stata 15.1 (Stata 15, College Station, TX) and figures were constructed using GraphPad PRISM 8.0. 
## Results
In total 1,725 participants were included for this analysis. As shown in Table 1, the proportion of diabetes in Asian Americans was estimated to be 16% (n=216), while the proportion of prediabetes in Asian Americans was estimated to be 31% (n=500). The mean age of the analytic sample was 47 years old, and the analytic sample was composed of 55% females and 45% males. Among the primary sleep measures, NSD/NSQ comprised most of the analytic sample (51%), while, LSD/PSQ comprised lowest of the analytic sample (2.4%). Overall, sleep measures that were stratified by NSQ yielded higher proportion of subjects than those of PSQ. Nearly all participants were defined with not having depression based on the PHQ-9 depression scale (97%). An estimated 63% of subjects reported to be US citizens and 37% reported to be non-US citizens. Most subjects were presented with normal BMI (54%), however, there was a high proportion of overweight participants (31%). Majority of the subjects were non-smokers, presented normal blood pressure levels, and engaged in no physical activity. Roughly equal proportions of subjects reported to have consumed and not consumed at least 12 drinks per year.

A total of 1,224 subjects from the final analytic sample provided measures for both diabetes and sleep duration/quality and a total of 1,509 provided measures for prediabetes and sleep duration/quality. Bivariate analysis for diabetes is shown in Table 2. Diabetes was found to be statistically significant with the primary outcome sleep duration/quality (p <0.002). All covariates were found to be statistically significant with exception of PHQ-9 and PAQ.
Prediabetes was not found to be statistically significant with the main exposure, sleep duration/quality (p <0.060). Therefore, logistic regression was only conducted for diabetes.

Stepwise logistic regression was performed to assess the relationship between diabetes and covariates shown in Table 3. Stepwise regression confirmed that all covariates adequately fitted the logistic regression model (p <0.001), apart from PHQ-9. Therefore, backward elimination of PHQ-9 was used to compensate for over fitting of the final logistic model.

The results of the final logistic model for diabetes and sleep duration/quality in Asian American subgroups are shown in Table 4, which was found to be statistically significant (p <0.001). The findings, shown in Figure 1, indicate that Asian Americans who reported having LSD/NSQ presented 2.32 (95% CI 1.05-5.14, p <0.038) higher odds of having diabetes than those who reported having NSD/NSQ. Additionally, subjects who reported having VSSD/PSQ and NSD/PSQ presented having 3.07 (95% CI 1.18-8.00, p <0.023) and 2.83 (95% CI 1.39-5.76, p <0.005) higher odds, respectively, than those subjects who reported having NSD/NSQ. Subsequent predictors were also found to be statistically significant, in order of odds ratio that include females, age, alcohol consumption, overweight (BMI), stage II hypertension, and obese (BMI). All other sleep measures did not suggest any relationship with diabetes.

## Discussion
Using the NHANES dataset, Asian Americans with NSD/PSQ had 2.83 higher odds of having diabetes than Asian Americans who had NSD/NSQ. This discovery aligns with the findings of the study conducted in South Korea, which found that among healthy populations, sleep quality, alone, was associated with an increase in glycemic levels in Asian populations. 8 It also further supports the results from another cross-sectional study using the NHANES that found subjects who reported having poor quality sleep were associated with 3.5 higher odds of having prediabetes. 9 Moreover, Asian Americans with LSD/NSQ and VSSD/PSQ had 2.32 higher odds and 3.07 higher odds of having diabetes than those who had NSD/NSQ, respectively. These results also support the findings of a study conducted in the US, which found that subjects who reported having short sleep (≤5 Hours) and long sleep (≥9 Hours) were, respectively, at 1.47 and 1.52 higher odds of developing diabetes than healthy individuals. 3 It also backs the results of a 5-year cross-sectional study conducted in China, where investigators discovered that individuals who reported having short sleep (≤5 Hours) in combination with poor quality of sleep, were at 6.21 times higher risk of developing diabetes than healthy individuals. 4 
The results of this study, in conjunction with findings of other studies, focusing on sleep quality in Asians, provides further weight to the notion that poor sleep quality and duration may adversely impact glycemic control in Asians; but more notably in respect to this study, in Asian Americans. 
Strength and Limitations
This study is unique in its assessment of glycemic status based on a combination of sleep duration and quality as sleep measures. With this approach of stratifying sleep duration by quality, the dichotomy between normal sleep duration and quality becomes more apparent, in addition to the amalgamated impact both risk factors can have on glycemic status. Additionally, this study defined prediabetes and diabetes using only A1c levels, therefore, circumventing self-report bias which may be indicated in prior studies that combined analytic populations with self-report diabetes status. In addition, A1c levels are currently the gold standard in defining prediabetes and diabetes, therefore, by using only A1c measurements this study can be seamlessly compared to other studies through this scope. Moreover, using the jacknife approach produced more conservative standard errors estimates, without affecting point estimates, which reduces the errors that are manifest in complex survey design. Furthermore, there has only been a sparse amount of research conducted on Asian American populations, and even less concerning diabetes and risk factors; this study targeted, solely, Asian Americans and glycemic status, providing much needed contributions to an area of research that is deeply lacking. 
Several limitations should be noted in the context of this study. In this study, the analytic sample size, Asian Americans with A1c measurements, was not very large. Therefore, CI levels were relatively wide for several of the associations between diabetes and sleep measures. Most notably, subjects who reported having VSSD/PSQ presented very wide CI levels (1.18-8.00) making it difficult to assess the reliability of this estimate. Moreover, the number of participants that reported having poor quality sleep were lower than those who reported having normal quality sleep. From the diabetic population, 41% of Asian Americans had NSD/NSQ compared to 8% of Asian Americans that had NSD/PSQ. The large variance in sample size can lead to biased estimates. However, the proportions for LSD/NSQ and VSSD/PSQ were comparable with their respective, sleep quality counterparts, which provide more weight to these findings. Additionally, there were no other statistically significant findings for other sleep measures. These limitations can be largely attributed to having a low sample size of Asian Americans, which may overestimate or underestimate the odds of having diabetes.
While, as of 2011, the NHANES have included Asian Americans as a separate race group, the Asian American group is not wholly representative of all Asian Americans in the US. The NHANES utilizes hand cards to facilitate translation when interpreters are not present, which are only available in Mandarin Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese, therefore it may underrepresent other Asian subgroups such as Asian Indians, which makes up a large proportion of Asian American populations. Moreover, the NHANES does not distinguish between Asian American subpopulations, therefore, it is not possible to make inferences for specific Asian-American subgroups. Consequently, these findings cannot be generalized to all Asian American subgroups, further inclusion of Asian subpopulations to the NHANES dataset is warranted for future studies. In addition, the NHANES does not provide information regarding the distinction between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes status, which introduces bias in analyzing the study sample. However, participants under the age of 25 years old were excluded from this study to mitigate this source of bias. In addition, using a cross-sectional survey does not allow for causal interpretations due to the nature of the data; thus, longitudinal prospective cohort studies would be needed to assess causal inferences between the impacts of sleep on glycemic status. 
The glycemic status used in this study was assessed using only one measurement of glycemic levels, HbA1c levels, which exclude participants who had presented assessments solely through self-report diagnosis, fasting blood glucose, and oral blood glucose tolerance tests. However, given that participants who presented fasting blood glucose and oral glucose tolerance test are only offered medical examinations in morning sessions, this may introduce selection bias. Finally, given that the data were self-reported, recall bias and social-desirability bias may be manifest, particularly, within covariates that were selected for estimation.
## Conclusions
The current prevalence of diabetes is enormously high, and the number of new cases continues to grow. This chronic metabolic condition reduces the quality of life and increases the risk of developing more severe health conditions to those affected. Additionally, management and cost of diabetes treatments place an enormous burden onto the US healthcare system, affecting the livelihood of every US citizen. Therefore, studies that investigate risk factors for diabetes onset is imperative. 
Adverse sleep duration and quality have been found to be associated with poor glycemic control. While Asians have been largely studied, investigations targeting Asian Americans have not been conducted pertinent with diabetes and sleep. By not doing so, renders a significant portion of the US susceptible to developing diabetes. Therefore, this study is essential for highlighting the association between sleep duration and quality with diabetes in Asian Americans. 
The findings have shown that NSD/PSQ, LSD/NSQ, and VSSD/PSQ increased the odds of having diabetes in Asian Americans. While, these results align with the pattern of previous literature, the magnitude of odds of having diabetes were attenuated among Asian Americans. Myriad of combination of factors can lead to this disparity. Perhaps, Asian Americans have learned to manage living healthier within a Western culture, while Asians, who have been, as recent, greatly exposed to Westernized diets may not have developed the behaviors that are needed to survive with a Westernized diet. Moreover, the importance of health differs between Asian and Western cultures. Asians are more opened to alternative medicines rather than traditional medicine such as acupuncture, which may also contribute to different outcomes. If Asians and Asian Americans both hold a genetic susceptibility for higher glycemic levels, which has been previously postulated, than either Westernized diets do not have large of an effect as previously claimed to be or it can be possible that Asian Americans have adapted to Western diets and learned to live healthier in the presence of Western foods.
Asian Americans has not been at the focal point of social diabetes research. This study examines Asian Americans as a different race group, apart from Asians, that has led to more accurate predictions. Although limitations are evident, this study is still edifying in many ways. The main limitation was due to a low sample size of Asian Americans, although this race group has been expanding at a very high rate in the US. This limitation sheds further support to the claim that there is a definitive need for further sampling of Asian Americans. The NHANES had included Asian Americans as a separate race/ethnicity group in 2011, therefore, over time more Asian Americans will be sampled to produce a larger analytic sample size that can provide more insight and impact for future studies. It is promising for the future that national surveys, akin to the NHANES, will be able to yield a larger analytic sample of Asian Americans. Thereby, enabling further high-quality studies to be conducted on Asian Americans on a national level.
